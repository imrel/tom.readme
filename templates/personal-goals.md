# Personal Goals Template

This is how I approach to my goals and I've seen my team embrace the approach successfully. Remember that it's a recommendation
rather than a requirement and you're free to tweak it as you like.

## Vision of myself in 6 months

Describe in your own words what you want to achieve, how you want your role to change and your motivations for it. For 
example:
> Now that I have a good overview of all products our team is responsible for, I want to focus more on the database design
> part. I read a PostgreSQL book as part of my last period's goals and I would like to apply them now. Also I would like
> to be handed more complex projects to lead. I feel that my communication with stakeholder needs improving, so I want
> to practice that. Currently I've been handling rather simple projects, but I would like to have more complex things
> where the means to achieve the desired outcome is not as simple and there is more communication between components.

## Goals for next period

Checklist for setting goals

- [ ] Go over the paragraph that you wrote above. Note the different **themes** that you can identify. As per example, 
we can identify two topics: Database design and Technical project management. Write them down as headings.
- [ ] Under each of the themes, think of the **outcomes** that you want to achieve in 6 months. Write them down.
- [ ] Under each **outcome** list at least one **action** that will be done. These need to be [Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

As you can see you don't have to fix all of your 6 months in advance. I would even advise against it. It's important
to set the themes and if possible, then outcomes. If you don't know how to set them, ask me and I can propose some. You
coming up with your own themes and outcomes is of course always preferable.
