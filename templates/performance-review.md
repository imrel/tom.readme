# Performance Review Template

## The past

Go over the checklist for period since last performance review and make notes.

- [ ] Go over all 1-1 notes since last review
    - What was the general mood of this period? Were you happy and performing or were there problems and struggling? 
    - Which topics came up multiple times? Write down recurring problems and let's see how we can eliminate them.
    - What were biggest wins? Where did you make biggest impact to the company?
    - In which are you grew the most this period?
    - What has been causing most stress for you?
- [ ] Go over all the plan items you have been responsible for  
    - Which were the best? What made them best? How can more plan items look like this one? What did you do to make them great?
    - Which were more problematic? What did/will you do to avoid the troublemakers?
    - Which ones were most enjoyable and vice versa? I will take that into account and try to make you get more of items that interest you. 
- [ ] Go over the goals that you set
    - Did all of the goals make sense in retrospect?
    - Are you clearly able to say if each goal was completed or not?
    - If not all were completed, why so?
    - Which goals were the best? Which types of the goals you will keep using? Which you will ditch?
    - Did you look at your goals frequently? If not, why so?
    - Did you feel engaged to your goals throughout the year in retrospect?
- [ ] Please write down answers to all of the questions below
    - What is your learning strategy? Do you feel that you acquire enough new knowledge? Do you actively follow any 
    information sources? Is that enough or do you feel you sometimes lack creative ideas and approaches to problems?
    - What has been biggest productivity booster for you during last period?
    - What should you do to achieve same things with less time?
    - What should your team lead do for our team to achieve same things with less time?
    - What should you do to achieve same things with less time?
    - What should your team lead do for our team to achieve greater results with same time?
    - What is the new innovative thing you would like to bring into our team the next period?

## The present

Think about your role today and make notes.

- Are you happy with your role in the team today? 
- Is the team heading in the right direction as of now?
- Are there any lingering issues, problems or topics that bother you without any prospect for resolution?
- Do you feel confident in your role?
- What are the topics you could share the knowledge in form of mentoring or trainings? Which products, processes, tips & tricks, coding etc..
- Are there any external factors that might negatively affect your performance?
- What are the most routine tasks you have to handle?
- What can your team lead or product owner do to help you?

## The future

Here you take all the input from past and present and create a favourable vision of the future that you would like to live.
It's important for me that you set the direction as to where you want to go and what you want to do. 

### Goals

- Set the personal goals for next period (usually 6 months). See the [goals template](personal-goals.md) on how to do that.
- If I forget to follow up on some of the goals, **bring them up yourself** at 1-1s. Goals are worth nothing if they
are only looked at twice a year. 
- Goals should be added to confluence as a public page so everyone can glimpse at what you're up to
- Goals page should be a living document and updated at least once a month. **This is up to you to do.**
- Let me explicitly know if you'd like help with something. I am more than happy to help bounce ideas and propose actions,
but this is not my first course of action because I would like you to initiate them.
