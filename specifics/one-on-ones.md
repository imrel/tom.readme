## One on one meetings

I see one on one meetings misused for chit-chatting or filled with operational topics, which I believe is wrong.

The purpose of 1-1 meetings is to periodically take time to
- identify what drives you and accordingly set your personal goals / strategic plans
- review progress of said goals and plans
- get my help on how to move forward with said goals and plans 
- discuss how to replicate victories and avoid failures and problems
- have private discussions around your well-being, ambitions, dislikes, career development

My guidelines for successful 1-1s are
- 1-1s are short, sweet and to the point. Chit-chat is nice, but we can go out for lunch for that 
- 1-1s are a place to have deeper discussions about more complex things/concepts and ways of doing things, not the place
for project updates and task reports 
- Come with an agenda. If you don't have an agenda, ping me in 1-1 slack channel and if my agenda is empty too, we'll
cancel it.
- If you have an urgent topic and need to handle it rather sooner than later, let me know and we'll have the 1-1 ASAP.

I have created a private Slack channel for us called **1-1-tom-yourname**. This channel is useful for capturing future
topics for us to discuss and making notes for 1-1 sessions.
Keeping regular private messages and 1-1 topics separate gives a really clear and easy to follow history of all our 1-1s.

If we agree on something, mark down what will be done by when in the 1-1 channel, so that we're clear on the deadline. 

All the rules and guidelines aside, the one on ones we'll have are still casual
